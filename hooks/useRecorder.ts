// useRecorder — sidepanel hook for the user-action recorder.

// Subscribes to status broadcasts via the `recorderChannel` singleton (the
// underlying port is owned by `useBackgroundAgent`). Exposes start/stop
// and status flags the toolbar button needs.
//
// `stop()` returns a `Promise<void>` that resolves once the background has
// finalized the recording. The captured session itself is NOT returned
// from this hook — it flows through `recorderChannel.subscribeSession`
// (see useComposerAttachments) so that every consumer (manual stop button, send-time
// auto-stop, cap-trigger) lands the session in attachments via the same
// path. We arm a one-shot session listener internally only as the resolve
// trigger; the BG fires it synchronously inside `recorder.stop()` so the
// promise effectively resolves as fast as the port round-trip allows.
