// Service Worker keep-alive with reference counting.
//
// Multiple subsystems (agent runs, active recording, ...) need to prevent
// SW termination independently. Each `acquire`s a token; the timer runs
// while at least one token is held and stops when the last is released.
//
// Mechanism: `chrome.runtime.getPlatformInfo` every 25 s resets Chrome's
// 30 s SW idle timer. Any extension API call works since Chrome 110 — we
// pick `getPlatformInfo` because it's a trivial read-only no-op.
//
// Reference: https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/develop/migrate/to-service-workers#keep-sw-alive
