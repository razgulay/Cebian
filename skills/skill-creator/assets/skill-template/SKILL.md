       `metadata.version` whenever you ship updates.
    3. Replace this comment and the body below with real instructions.
    4. Add scripts/ and references/ subdirectories only if you actually use them.

# my-skill

Short overview of what this skill does, in one or two sentences. Keep it
focused — anything about *when* to use the skill belongs in `description`,
not here.

## Instructions

Step-by-step workflow the agent should follow when this skill activates.
Use imperative form.

1.
2.
3.

## Examples

Optional. Show one or two concrete input → output pairs so the agent
calibrates against your intent. Drop this section entirely if there are
no examples.

## References

Link to detail-heavy material the agent should load on demand:

- `references/REFERENCE.md` — (create when needed)

Drop this section entirely if there are no `references/` files.
